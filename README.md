# Color Converter
A simple React project to convert RGB into other color values.

# React with Bun runtime

This is a React project bootstrapped with [bun](https://bun.sh/).

## Getting Started
You will need to install bun from https://bun.sh/.
### Cloning the repo
Make sure to run the following commands to avoid errors with bun
```sh
git clone git@github.com:connordecamp/color-converter-react.git
cd color-converter-react
bun install
bun dev
```

Open http://localhost:3000 with your browser to see the result. I want to figure out how to serve the site to gh-pages.
